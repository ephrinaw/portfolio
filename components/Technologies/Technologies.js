      I have experience using a range of technologies for web
      development including, JavaScript and React for building user interfaces, Python for
      data analysis and artificial intelligence, MySQL and MongoDB for database management,
      Git for version control, and cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web
      Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Azure for building, deploying, and
      managing applications and services. I have also used Java as a student in my school. 
      These technologies have enabled me to work
      on a variety of projects and tasks, and have given me the skills and
      knowledge on field of computer science and software
      development.
